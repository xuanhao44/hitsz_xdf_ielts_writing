step 1

subject: Coffee and tea buying and drinking habits in five cities in Australia

I can't conclude anything from the bar chart.

tense: past tense

unit: percentage (of city residents)

---

step 2 paragraphing

category? or pattern? — certainly categories here.

1. 3 kinds of bars
2. 3 kinds of bars, but divided into 2 parts: buying, drinking
3. 5 cities.

choose 1.

3 kinds of bars — 3 para.

step 3 Sequence information logically in body paragraphs.

Firstly, clearly it's a static graph.

in bar 1, 5 cities; in bar 2, 5 cities; in bar 3, 5 cites. Oops, the same way over and over again!

So change ways in step 2, we choose 2. Then in step 3:

1. buying, we can compare fresh and instant.
2. drinking, we can compare 5 cities.

初稿写作想法：

大脑一片空白。

- 花了好长时间构思；

- 不但如此，写出来的文章让我自己也不满意。
  - 首先逻辑上我有点疑惑不知道分的对不对；

  - 其次我不知道数据是不是写的太简略了；

  - 最后是静态图句式没怎么用上。
