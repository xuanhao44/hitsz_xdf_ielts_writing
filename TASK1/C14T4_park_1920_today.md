尝试写：

In 1920, the grange park was located between the Arnold avenue and Eldon street in a  rectangular area. The entrances were on the north and south sides of the park. **In the centre of the park** lay a fountain. There was a stage for musicians to the west of the fountain. A glasshouse could be found to the southeastern of the fountain, while a pond for water plants was located to the northeastern of the fountain. Five seats and three rose gardens were on the four edges of the park.

Sample:

In 1920, Grange Park was a rectangular area, **with access** from Arnold Avenue and Eldon Street on the north and south sides of the park. There was a fountain in the center, **with** a stage for musicians on its west side, a pond for water plants to the east of the north entrance and **a glasshouse in the southeast corner of park opposite**. On the four edges of the park sat some seats and rose gardens.

Cohesion:

1. , with … **简洁**。
2. 错误例子：A pond for water plants was in the northeast corner of the park. ~~The pond for water is opposite a glasshouse.~~ A glasshouse was opposite the pond for water plants.
   - 首先描述 glasshouse 的时候应该把 glasshouse 当作主语。
   - 其次 opposite 用的不准确。需要先写精准定位，然后再考虑写 opposite（sample 句子）

GRA:

1. At the center of the park lay a fountain --> **In the center of the park lay a fountain**
2. At the end of the road/at the intersection/at the junction
